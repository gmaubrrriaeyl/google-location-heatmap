# google-location-heatmap
Users that opt into Google's location history tracker can access multiple years of device location history. This script parses the user's location history, creates an Open Street Maps using the Follium library, and adds the user's location history to the map. Variation in color is used to display location clustering.  The CreateTemporalHeatmap function allows the user to limit data to a given date range.
